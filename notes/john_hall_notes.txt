take a look at individual case studies

electron rocket labs 
- 3d printing rocket parts

big niche
- reduce the cost of whatever the big guys are doing


component providers
satellite companies
rocket companies


Government funded stuff: 
- UK space agency

rutherford appleton laboratory?


US
- giant pile of VCs that will throw money at stuff
- Space Angles VC (launch vehicles, firefly)


Expecting a lot of investment to move into Ukraine once the war dies down


Looking for money? 
Find a space consulting firm and they'll marry you to an existing set of VSs

Nasa Grants
- problem specific, do this research, no equity taken


Nasa / NSA / Darpa investments
- new technology development 
- less focused on sharing data (cause military)
- Some deals happen where nasa funds, but the company is private. 
- Nasa will get some sort of licsing deal for that technology.
- SpaceAct Agreement (https://www.nasa.gov/partnerships/about.html)


All nasa offices have "Technology Transfer" offices
"Announcement of Opportunity" - if you're in touch with a tech transfer office they can tell you 
what AO's are available at the time. Some are science based (leading to grants), some engineering based (leading to contracts)
some are cooperative development. Pretty mature system.
They also have RFPs (request for proposals) which tend to be more for hardware. 


What if I want to launch a rocket
- FAA approval
- Best to use an established range (spacex decided to launch themselves)
- If I wanted my own launchpad - FAA & DOD will have to approve it
- Nasa co-owns launchpads with DOD (Mid atlantic range? is one.)
- There is one in Kodiak alaska!?
- Congress is trying to make this process less complex, but unlikely they will succeed. 
- Work with state agencies to get approcal (New Mexico, Florida, Alaska)
- Wollaps island (nasa launches space station missions). Works for non-people missions.

Extra thoughts: 
- If you had something different (i.e 3d printed rocket, special radiation shielding, green propellent)


You would go to the Mid Atlantic Range S(something) and ask for approval for launch.
You get in the queue, and it's often rather congested. 

If you go to the 45th airforce website they probably have the range schedule. It's public info. 


Who has to rubber stamp astroforge's launch
- Crongress Space Act (not the NASA one) 
- Jim Bridenstein
- Led the charge for getting the FAA / Department of Commerce to take a light touch to 
- applications like astroforge, or On Orbit Satellite Maintainance 
- Right now you need
  - FAA
  - FCC
  - Commerce Department
- Commerce Dept is not actively involved yet, but gov wants them to be involved in the licsing process.

Nasa has already put together some partnerships for moon-mining
They run some challenges, prize money. Google X money as well

Gateway Luner activity


Projects 
- Anything dealing with radiation / hardening / shielding. Still a huge challenge.
- Anything that makes the space environment a little less hostile
- Extending the life of any in orbit systems
- Bringing down the cost and weight of propellent
- Better thrusters
- Waste recycling & removal


Look into the NASA startup studio or NASA Technology Transfer offices. 
That will tell you the problems they are trying to address. 

And not just NASA. DARPA has the same sort of mechanisms. 


Bring down the scope
- I'd like to build a sensor for a satellite
- A drill for space



Space professional associations
GISS in manhattan? 
Goddard Institute for Space Studies - Colombia 
Big NASA facility in Baltimore
Best would be AIMS research center (sunnyvale california)
