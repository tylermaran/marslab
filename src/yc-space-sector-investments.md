# YC's 18 space industry investments

Y Combinator (YC) is a startup accelerator and venture capital firm that's invested in more than 3,500 companies. Of that 3,500 company portfolio the majority has always been software (with b2b SASS making up ~70%). **But** there's a tiny sliver of that pie pointed towards space. And that's what I'm most interested in tracking.

I've compiled a list of companies working on developing technology and infrastructure for space exploration, satellite deployment, and space-based services such as communication and data collection. YC's investment in these companies reflects the growing interest in the commercial space industry and the potential for innovation and growth in this field.

_All the data here is pulled from the [YC company directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies), searching by space, satellite, rocket, etc. and thrown into a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cGQw-l4RnYFPNogkcYjo4dCHwPhw_tWs_M6cBOSi3h8/edit#gid=0)). If you think there's some missing companies shoot me an [email](mailto:tyler.maran@gmail.com) and I'll update the list._

### Summary financials

<img alt='fundraising waterfall' src='./fundraising_waterfall.png'>

Since 2016, Y Combinator has invested in 18 companies in the space sector, with 11 of them receiving additional investment from other venture capital firms. To date, only 2 of these companies have made it beyond Series B funding rounds. This suggests that while Y Combinator has been actively investing in space companies, the majority of these companies are still in the early stages of development and have not yet reached the level of maturity and success that would warrant later-stage funding.

<img alt='all investments' src='./yc_space_investment_list.png'>

This is not uncommon for startups, especially in high-risk, high-tech industries like space. The fact that 12 of the companies received additional investment from other venture capital firms, despite the small number of companies that have reached later stages, may reflect the growing interest in the space industry and the potential for innovation and growth in this field.

### Investments per year

<img alt='total investments since 2016' src='./total_investments.png'>

_Grouped by YC investment year (i.e. W19, S19)_

While the number of investments in space companies by Y Combinator and other venture capital firms is increasing, it is still relatively small compared to overall investment activity. Space companies made up 1% of YC's total cohort. Practically a rounding error.

This can be seen as an indication that the space industry is still in its early stages of development, and that the potential for growth and innovation is significant. Additionally, it can also indicate that the venture capital community is still cautious about investing in space companies, as the industry has high technical and regulatory barriers, and a high level of risk. Despite this, the increasing investments in space companies demonstrates the growing interest and confidence in the potential of the space industry as a viable commercial sector.

## Who are the founders

I was honestly quite surprised by the diversity here. I had expeced to see 38 ex-SpaceX / ex-Blue Origin founders here. But that only accounts for 7 of the 18 companies. All invetments had at least one cofounder with prior aerospace experience.
